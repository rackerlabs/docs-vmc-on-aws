Using Dedicated vCenter Server
==============================

This section describes the following Dedicated vCenter Server tasks:

-  Obtaining guest OS images

-  Assigning IP addresses

-  Activating Rackspace provided OS image licenses

-  Managing capacity

-  Adding permissions

Obtaining guest OS images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon request, Rackspace will provide images to deploy when your initial
deployment is complete. Rackspace does not update the images with
patches and updates unless a specific support request is made.

To update the guest images, Rackspace will schedule maintenance,
disconnect the existing templates and reconnect new updated templates.
During this maintenance window, accessing the existing templates will
cause an error.

Assigning IP addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a best practice, during the sales process and implementation call,
your environmentâ€™s IP count and allocation is reviewed. When additional
IP addresses are needed, contact your Rackspace Support team.

Activating Rackspace provided OS image licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you purchase OS licensing from Rackspace, instructions on how to
activate the licensing is provided by your account team.

Managing capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are responsible for capacity management and must inform Rackspace
when additional resources are required. To aid in capacity planning, use
VMware vRealize Operations (vROps) provided by Rackspace. vROps has
advanced forecasting, monitoring and rightsizing capabilities, as well
as alerts through email and SNMP.

If you have additional software you want to use, Rackspace will assist
in installing and configuring the software on a time and materials
basis.

Adding permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can utilize the entire API within the boundaries of the permission
set. Additional permissions may be enabled on a case-by-case basis. See
the VMware site for the most up-to-date API information:
