Additional VMware services
==========================

In addition to the Dedicated vCloud and vCenter servers, additional
types of servers can be displayed in the management cluster. The number
and type of these servers can change over time. The following is a brief
description of additional server types.

Virtual machine recovery appliance
 A virtual machine recovery appliance enables image-based backup of
 the management cluster VMs and provides point-in-time data
 restoration as well as entire VM restoration. These features allow
 Rackspace to quickly recover VMs or data in the management cluster.
 This system is only for use by Rackspace for this purpose and will
 not back up any of the VMs created in Dedicated vCloud. No customer
 access is provided.

vShield Manager
 VMware vShield Manager is a required component of Dedicated
 Dedicated vCloud that is intended to be accessed through features in
 Dedicated vCloud. No direct customer access is provided.

vRealize Operations (vROps) Virtual Appliance
 VMware vRealize™ Operations™ (vROps) is a customer-managed software
 tool from the VMware vRealize Suite product line. It provides
 read-only visibility into the VMware vSphere infrastructure and host
 machines. The tool monitors the performance and efficiency of the
 hosted compute infrastructure, and also enables capacity planning.

VMware Update Manager
 The Update Manager automates patch management and eliminates manual
 tracking and patching of vSphere hosts and virtual machines. It
 compares the state of vSphere hosts with baselines, then updates and
 patches hosts to enforce compliance. Rackspace uses this system to
 maintain dedicated VMware services. No customer access is provided.
