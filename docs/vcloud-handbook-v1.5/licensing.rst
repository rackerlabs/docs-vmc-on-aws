Licensing
=========

VMware licenses purchased from Rackspace for Dedicated vCloud are
installed during provisioning. Customer-supplied VMware licenses are
applied by Rackspace when Dedicated vCloud is provisioned. Prior to this
point, a VMware installation uses an evaluation license.

Windows VM OS licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy a Windows virtual machine and you purchased host-based OS
licensing from Rackspace, it can be activated with the Rackspace KMS
server. Use the instructions provided by your Rackspace account team.

.. note::

   The Rackspace KMS server is only accessible to systems hosted with
   Rackspace.

Red Hat VM OS licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy a Red Hat virtual machine and you purchased host-based OS
licensing from Rackspace, it can be activated with the Rackspace RHN
server. Use the instructions provided by your Rackspace account team.

   The Rackspace RHN server is only accessible to systems hosted with
   Rackspace.
