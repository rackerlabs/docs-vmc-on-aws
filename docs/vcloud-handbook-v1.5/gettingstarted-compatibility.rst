Compatibility
=============

Dedicated vCloud is not compatible with all Rackspace products and
services. Contact your Rackspace support specialist for detailed
information about whether any specific Rackspace product is compatible
with your Dedicated vCloud.

Compatibility with third-party products
 Dedicated vCloud can be accessed using the vCloud API. You can use
 any third-party management, orchestration, or other type of tools
 that are compatible with the vCloud API. In this case, the
 functionality of any such tool will be limited by the Dedicated
 vCloud features and capabilities as described in this handbook.
 Please ensure the vCloud API version of your environment and its
 compatibility with the third-party tools that you would like to use.

Determination of compatibility when elevated permissions are needed
 In some cases, existing role permissions provided by Rackspace do
 not allow a custom or third-party tool to function. Contact the
 Rackspace account team to determine if role permission adjustments
 are possible.
