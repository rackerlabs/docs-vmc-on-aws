Hybrid Cloud Extension
======================

VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) is an all-in-one workload mobility tool. It
enables migrations and cloud onboarding without the need to retrofit the source
infrastructure by building an abstraction layer between on-premises data
centers
and the cloud. HCX supports migration from vSphere 5.0 and later without
introducing application risk and complex migration assessments. With VMware
HCX,
the on-premises vSphere environment and cloud environments no longer need to be
tightly coupled.
