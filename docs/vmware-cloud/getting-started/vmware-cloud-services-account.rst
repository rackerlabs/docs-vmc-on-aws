=============================
VMware Cloud Services account
=============================

VMware Cloud Services accounts are based on organizations. After a Rackspace
account is created, a VMware Cloud Services organization is created for you.

At this time, only one VMware Cloud Services organization can be created under
a single Rackspace account. If you need more than one VMware Cloud on AWS
organization, separate Rackspace accounts might need to be created.

After the creation of the organization, the VMware Cloud on AWS service is
activiated in the organization. Software-Defined Data Centers (SDDC) are
subsequently provisioned based on the specified requirements by using the
VMware Cloud on AWS service.
