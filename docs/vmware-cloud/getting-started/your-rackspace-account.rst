Your Rackspace account
======================

As part of the onboarding process, we create your Rackspace account and
enable your access by using the `MyRackspace portal <https://my.rackspace.com>`_.
We recommend that you take a moment to watch the `Rackspace 101 <https://my.rackspace.com/portal/video/show/31>`_
tutorial video found within **Video Knowledge Base** of the **Community**
section in the MyRackspace portal. This featured video is designed to help
you understand how to navigate through the portal.

.. note::

   You are able to access the preceding links only if you are a customer of

This video shows you how to create a ticket, manage online devices, and perform
several administrative or technical tasks.
