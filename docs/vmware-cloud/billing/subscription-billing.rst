Subscription billing
====================

If you purchase a one or three year subscription, you are billed for reserved
host capacity for the term of the subscription. You have the option to pay the
full term up front or pay Rackspace in monthly installments with an additional
finance fee.

Fees for Rackspace support are billed in monthly installments, and you are
also billed in arrears, at on-demand rates, for metered usage charges and
any host usage in excess of the committed capacity purchased in your
subscription. Metered usage charges are IP address usage, IP address remaps,
egress data, and protected VMs.
