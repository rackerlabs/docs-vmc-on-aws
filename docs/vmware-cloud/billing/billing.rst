Billing
=======

When you sign up for Managed VMware Cloud on AWS, Rackspace becomes your
reseller of VMware Cloud services. This means that all billing of both
infrastructure and support is provided through a consolidated Rackspace bill,
and you do not have to maintain a payment relationship with VMware directly.
