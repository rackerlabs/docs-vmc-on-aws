====================================
Rackspace Shared Management Services
====================================

Rackspace takes the security of Rackspace Shared Management Services and the
MyRackspace Customer Portal extremely seriously. All infrastructure is
deployed by leveraging the same set of best practices that we apply to
customer projects.

Racker authentication
---------------------
All Rackspace employees must leverage two-factor authentication for all access
to customer account data and customer environments.

Racker privileges
-----------------
The level of privileges each Racker has to our Managed VMware Cloud on AWS
Platform management systems is tightly controlled based on job role and is
periodically reviewed to ensure that each Racker has the minimum level of
permissions required to adequately perform their job duties. All privilege
changes require management approval and are also logged for later review.

Encryption at rest
------------------
All sensitive data is encrypted at rest.

Encryption in transit
---------------------
All communication between services that make up our shared management system
are encrypted during transit by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Our customer
and Racker user interfaces (UIs) and application program interfaces (APIs) are
accessible only by using HTTPS.
