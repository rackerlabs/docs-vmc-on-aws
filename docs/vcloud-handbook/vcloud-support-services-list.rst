Dedicated VMware vCloud services
================================

Rackspace provides some specific support and automation services for the
Dedicated VMware vCloud environment and the virtual machines that are
built in it.

Infrastructure support
    Rackspace delivers Fanatical Experienceâ„¢ for the hardware infrastructure
    resources including Network, Server and Storage components.

VMware virtualization services
    Rackspace is one of VMware's largest global vCloud Air Network
    partners, with elevated access to technical specialists for rapid
    resolution of unexpected software-related issues within the VMware
    stack.

    Rackspace's VMware Certified Professionals (VCPs) assist in the
    architecture, deployment and troubleshooting of the environment.
    Rackspace monitors and maintains the VMware software stack,
    including installing and configuring the vCloud, vCenter and vROps
    servers, backing up the VMware service VMs, and monitoring the
    hypervisors. Rackspace supports the vCloud and vCenter web UI, and
    APs.

Virtual machines
    Rackspace patches and monitors guest operating systems, backs up
    VMs, and installs and patches antivirus on VMs created from
    Rackspace Managed OS templates. Rackspace also provides support for
    Rackspace unmanaged or customer-provided virtual machine containers
    and their performance within the cloud. See :ref:`vcloud-vm-types`
    and :ref:`vcloud-vm-requirements` for more information.

vCloud support automation
    Certain activities in vCloud trigger Rackspace automation. This
    allows Rackspace to populate information in the support systems for
    tracking, monitoring, and supporting VMs created in vCloud. See
    :ref:`vcloud-automation-events` for more information.
