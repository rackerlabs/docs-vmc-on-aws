Compatibility
=============

Dedicated VMware vCloud is compatible with certain other Rackspace
products. Contact your Rackspace support specialist for detailed
information.

 Additional guest OS software
    To install MS SQL Server, Sharepoint, Microsoft Exchange, MySQL, or
    other Rackspace-provided software in a Dedicated VMware vCloud VM,
    contact the Rackspace account team.

 Compatibility with third-party products
    Rackspace is working to certify third-party products for use with
    Dedicated VMware vCloud such as vRealize Automation (formerly vCloud
    Automation Center) and vCloud Connector. Rackspace provides details
    about the compatibility level and requirements as they become
    available.

 Determination of compatibility when elevated permissions are needed
    In some cases, existing role permissions provided by Rackspace do
    not allow a custom or third-party tool to function. Contact the
    Rackspace account team to determine if role permission adjustments
    are possible.
