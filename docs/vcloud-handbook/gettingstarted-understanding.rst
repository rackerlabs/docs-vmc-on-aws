Understanding Dedicated VMware vCloud
=====================================

The Dedicated VMware vCloud service uses a software suite that creates
an abstraction layer on top of VMware vCenter Servers. This software
makes creating virtual machines (VMs) for a variety of workloads easy.
Rackspace configures the infrastructure, sets up virtual networks, and
establishes storage policies. With the Rackspace catalog of vApp
templates in the vCloud web portal, you can create VMs for testing,
development, or production.

Rackspace can help you set cloud policies that control how resources are
used. Optionally, you can segregate business units or groups of users
into "organizations" within the hosted private cloud. Users can
provision resources in this application, where they have access to vApps
and the resources used by vApps, without involving IT.
