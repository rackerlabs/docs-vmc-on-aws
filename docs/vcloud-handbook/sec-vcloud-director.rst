====================
vCloud Director tabs
====================

The vCloud Director interface contains the following tabs.

- The **Home** tab displays the running vApps in the environment and
  the number of days until their Lease expires. On the right side of
  the page, a **Tasks** section gives quick access to most tasks and to
  organization management links.

- The **My Cloud** tab displays the vApp and VMs. The tag also displays
  expired items and logs. This tab enables creation of vApps from
  Catalog or OVF.

- The **Catalogs** tab displays the Catalogs, vApp Templates, and
  Media. The resources to create new vApps and the Rackspace-provided
  catalogs of VM templates are also displayed. The Rackspace catalog is
  read-only, but any additional catalogs will be available through the
  following sub-tabs:

   - The **Media & Other** tab is where ISOs can be uploaded or
     accessed.

   - The **vApp Templates** is where new Templates can be loaded.
     Modified or existing Templates can be copied and removed from the
     inventory.

   - The **Catalogs** tab is where catalogs can be accessed and some
     properties can be changed.
