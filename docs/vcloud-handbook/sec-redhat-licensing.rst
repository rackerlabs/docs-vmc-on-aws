=======================
Red Hat VM OS licensing
=======================

If you deploy a supported Red Hat virtual machine from the Rackspace
catalog, the Windows license is automatically activated against our RHN
server. Unsupported Red Hat virtual machines also activate with the
Rackspace RHN server, but require additional manual steps. Follow the
instructions provided by the Rackspace account team, who can provide
specific activation keys.
