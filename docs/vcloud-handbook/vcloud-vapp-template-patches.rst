Monthly template patching
=========================

Each month, OS vendors release patches to address security, stability,
performance or other concerns. Rackspace will update the templates in
the Rackspace catalog on a monthly basis to provide the most up-to-date
versions of each operating System. A notification of monthly patches is
sent to indicate which patches will be applied.
