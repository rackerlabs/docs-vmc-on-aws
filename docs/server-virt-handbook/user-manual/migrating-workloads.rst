Migrating workloads to VMware Server Virtualization
===================================================

Several options, described in the following sections, are available to
customers migrating their workloads to VMware Server Virtualization.

Data migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace provisions new virtual machines for customers to perform a manual
data migration.

Import from OVA/OVF file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers can send physical media to Rackspace to import existing OVA/OVF
file(s) into their VMware Server Virtualization environment. These imports are
considered unmanaged VMs (see :ref:`Roles and responsibilities
<svh-roles-and-responsibilities>` for more details) unless reconfigured to meet
Rackspace managed support standards. For more details around reconfiguration
process, consult your account team.

Professional Services migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers work with our professional service team to design, plan, and
migrate their existing workloads into VMware Server Virtualization
environments.
