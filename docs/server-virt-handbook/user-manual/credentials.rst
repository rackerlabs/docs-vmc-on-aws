Credentials Management
======================

Rackspace maintains a formal password policy in accordance with ISO27001
requirements, for Rackspace credentials to your environment. These credentials
give Rackspace the ability to provide managed services and enable automation,
like virtual machine cloning.

While customers have full administrator access to modify passwords and accounts
as they feel necessary, Rackspace advises against making changes to the
Rackspace account to avoid impacting your support experience. If modifications
are made, engage support to ensure Rackspace recorded credentials are updated.
