Accessing the MyRackspace portal
================================

After your configuration is built to your specifications by the
Rackspace team and is online, you will receive a ticketed
message that includes your username and password information.

These usernames and passwords will enable you to access the
`MyRackspace portal <https://my.rackspace.com>`_. We recommend you to take a
moment to watch the `Rackspace 101 <https://my.rackspace.com/portal/video/show/31>`_
tutorial video found within ``Video Knowledge Base`` of the ``Community``
section in your MyRackspace portal. This featured video is designed to help
you understand how to navigate through the portal.

.. note::

   You will only be able to access the above links if you are a customer of
   Rackspace.

This video shows you how to create a ticket, manage
online devices, and perform several administrative or technical tasks.
For written instructions on how to manage online devices, see the
section on managing virtual machines.
