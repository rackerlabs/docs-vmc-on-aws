SLA information, compliance information, and links to other information
are provided in the following sections.

SLA information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace offers two service level agreements (SLAs) to choose from with
the VMware Server Virtualization solution:

* Managed
* Intensive

Both Managed and Intensive SLAs offer 24x7x365 access to a dedicated account
team that provides support when building your solution, architecting,
migrating, securing, operating your cloud, and ongoing optimization.

The dedicated account team includes an Account Manager, Solution Engineer,
Implementation Coordinator, Business Development Consultant, Billing
Specialist, and, depending on your service level, an Enterprise Support
Engineer.

To see a detailed comparison of these two service levels, or learn more
about our Rackspace Application Services with an SLA that provides
a 100% production platform uptime guarantee, see the
`Dedicated Hosting Services Product Terms  <https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/DedicatedHostingTerms>`_ page.
