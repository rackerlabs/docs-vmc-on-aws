Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware allows IT organizations to benefit
from the capabilities of a VMware based private cloud, without having to
invest time, energy, and resources building and managing the ongoing
operations of running and optimizing VMware software and the underlying
physical infrastructure that powers it. This freesup your staff to focus on
higher value activities such as automating service delivery and other
innovation initiatives so that you can deliver great outcomes for
your business at a lower TCO and with less risk when compared to building it
yourselfin your own datacenter.

IT operations teams get to benefit from VMware’s software-defined technology
and the agile infrastructure deployment model for physical hardware that comes
with working with Rackspace. Legacy and non-cloud-native applications can be
operated with cloud-like agility, without requiring IT teams to sacrifice
their existing investments in VMware skills, tools, and software.
RPC-VMware is built on VMware Cloud Foundation validated designs, allowing for
predictable low-risk deployments, continuous updates for the most up-to-date
VMware capabilities, as well as improved lifecycle management of VMware
components.
