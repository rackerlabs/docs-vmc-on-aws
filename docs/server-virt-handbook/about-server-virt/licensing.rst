Licensing
=========

Licensing is handled in several ways for VMware Server Virtualization.

VMware licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers cannot provide their own VMware licensing. VMware ESX licensing is
leased through Rackspace and installed during provisioning.

Windows licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers can provide their own Windows OS and SQL licensing or lease
Rackspace-provided Windows licenses. If you lease Windows licensing from
Rackspace, it can be activated with the Rackspace Key Management Service
(KMS) server.
 
Red Hat OS licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Customers can provide their own OS licenses or lease a Rackspace-provided Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) OS license. If you lease OS licensing from
Rackspace, it can be activated with the Rackspace Red Hat Network (RHN) server.

Oracle licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers can provide their own Oracle licenses or lease Rackspace-provided
Oracle licensing.
