vSAN compatibility
------------------

vSAN might not be compatible with all Rackspace products and services.
Contact your Rackspace Support specialist for detailed information
about whether any specific Rackspace product is compatible with your
vSAN.

vSAN compatibility with third-party products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access vSAN by using the vSAN API. You can use any third-party
management, orchestration, or other type of tools that are compatible
with the vSAN API. In this case, the functionality of any such tool
is limited by the vSAN features and capabilities as described in
this handbook. Ensure that the vSAN API version of your environment
is compatible with the third-party tools that you want to use.


vSAN compatibility when elevated permissions are needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, existing role permissions provided by Rackspace do not
allow a custom or third-party tool to function. Contact the Rackspace
account team to determine if role permission adjustments are possible.
