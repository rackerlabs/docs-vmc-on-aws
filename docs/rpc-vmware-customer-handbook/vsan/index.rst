==========================
VMware vSAN for RPC-VMware
==========================

VMware vSAN™ is an enterprise-grade, hyperconverged software-defined
storage solution optimized for VMware VMs that is natively embedded in
the vSphere hypervisor. vSAN provides service-level and policy
management at the VM and virtual machine disk (VMDK) level, provides
performance quality of service (QoS) capability at the
VM level, and allows enterprise-grade scalability for capacity and
performance without the need for a large upfront investment.

vSAN enables the use of the Rackspace Private Cloud powered by VMware
(RPC-VMware) environment to manage and
provision storage through self-service, and to also offer role-based
self-service access to other users within the organization. vSAN allows
storage policy to be set for availability, performance, and QoS
at the VM and VMDK levels, while eliminating the concept of LUN,
volume, and RAID to make storage provisioning and management simple for
use by a VMware administrator. In addition, vSAN also allows for integration
into VMware vRealize® Operations™ and vRealize Automation™ to provide
end-to-end Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) manageability and
service delivery.

This handbook is your primary resource for information related to the
vSAN component for RPC-VMware, such as getting started, using,
