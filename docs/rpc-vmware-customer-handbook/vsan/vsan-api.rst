Detailed API documentation is located on the `VMware API and SDK Documentation
site <https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/sdk_pubs.html>`_.

Rackspace does not provide developer support for the APIs for any of the
RPC-VMware components. However, Rackspace can coordinate with VMware to
address your questions and issues.
