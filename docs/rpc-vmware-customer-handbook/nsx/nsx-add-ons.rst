=======================
Optional add-on for NSX
=======================

Customers can add *service deployments* to their NSX environment. A
service deployment is a partner service offered by a
third-party company. This partner service could be a third-party
firewall or a guest introspection service, for example. Rackspace does
not provide managed services for any partner service not installed by
Rackspace and makes no guarantees that all partner services will work
with NSX for RPC-VMware.
