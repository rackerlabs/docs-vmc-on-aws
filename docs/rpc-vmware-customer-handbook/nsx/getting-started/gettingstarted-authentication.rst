NSX authentication methods
--------------------------

The customer can use the same authentication methods that are used with
vCenter to access the NSX section of the web client. However, you may
have to work with Rackspace support to import groups or individuals into
vCenter from your on-premises AD. Once these groups or individuals are added
to vCenter you need to give them the permission level desired
through the NSX section in the web client.
