NSX compatibility
-----------------

NSX for RPC-VMware might not be compatible with all Rackspace products
and services. Contact your Rackspace Support specialist for detailed
information about whether any specific Rackspace product is compatible
with NSX for RPC-VMware.

The NSX version used with your RPC-VMware environment is compatible with
all other components in RPC-VMware. Upgrades are only performed only if the
upgrade is compatible with all the other components in RPC-VMware.

NSX compatibility with third-party products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NSX can be accessed by using the NSX API. You can use any third-party
management, orchestration, or other type of tools that are compatible
with the NSX API. In this case, the functionality of any such tool will
be limited by the NSX features and capabilities as described in this
handbook. Ensure that the NSX API version of your environment is
compatible with the third-party tools that you want to use.

NSX compatibility when elevated permissions are needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, existing role permissions provided by Rackspace do not
allow a custom or third-party tool to function. Contact the Rackspace
account team to determine if role permission adjustments are possible.
