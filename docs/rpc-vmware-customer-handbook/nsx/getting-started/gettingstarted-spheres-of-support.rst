NSX spheres of support
----------------------

The NSX appliance and all supporting infrastructure are supported by
Rackspace. Internally, we use Rackspace Monitoring to
monitor the health of the NSX appliance. The support of the underlying
networking of the NSX environment is also supported by Rackspace.
