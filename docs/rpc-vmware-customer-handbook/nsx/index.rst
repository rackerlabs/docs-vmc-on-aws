VMware NSX for RPC-VMware
=========================

VMware NSX® is the network virtualization platform for the
Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC), delivering the operational model of
a VM for entire networks. With NSX, network functions
including switching, routing, and firewalling are embedded in the
hypervisor and distributed across the environment. This effectively
creates a “network hypervisor” that acts as a platform for virtual
networks and services.

Like the operational model of VMs, virtual networks are programmatically
provisioned and managed independently of underlying hardware. NSX
reproduces the entire network model in software, enabling any network
topology— from simple to complex multitier networks— to be created and
provisioned in seconds. Users can create multiple virtual networks with
diverse requirements, leveraging a combination of the services offered
via NSX to build inherently more secure environments.

This handbook is your primary resource for information related to NSX for
RPC-VMware. Such as, getting started, using, and getting help. It also

NSX is not available as a stand-alone product.
