What is Site Recovery Manager?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VMware Site Recovery Manager is an automation software that integrates with an
underlying replication technology to provide policy-based management,
non-disruptive testing, and automated orchestration of recovery plans. Site
Recovery Manager is designed for virtual machines and protecting applications
running in a VMware vSphere® environment.

To deliver flexibility and choice, Site Recovery Manager integrates natively
with vSphere Replication™ leveraging the benefits of VMware vSphere. Site
Recovery Manager also takes advantage of the Software-Defined Data Center
(SDDC) architecture by integrating with other VMware solutions such as VMware
NSX (network virtualization) and VMware vSAN (software-defined storage powering
leading hyper-converged infrastructure solutions). By allowing users to test
and automate the migration process of applications between sites at scale with
minimal or no downtime, Site Recovery Manager fulfills the needs for a variety
of use cases such as disaster recovery, disaster avoidance, planned data center
migrations, site-level load balancing, and application maintenance testing.

Site Recovery Manager ensures fast and highly predictable recovery times,
simplifies management through automation, and minimizes the total cost of
ownership, making it the industry-leading solution to enable application
availability and mobility across sites in private cloud environments.

Key features and capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Traditional disaster recovery (DR) solutions that rely on manual processes
often fail to meet business requirements because they are too expensive,
complex, and unreliable. Site Recovery Manager automates every aspect of
executing a recovery plan in order to accelerate recovery and eliminate the
risks involved with manual processes. Organizations using Site Recovery
Manager obtain the following features and benefits:

#. Non-disruptive recovery testing – performs automated failover testing as
   frequently as needed in an isolated network to avoid impact to production
   applications and ensure regulatory compliance through detailed reports.

#. Automated orchestration workflows – performs the DR failover or a planned
   migration, failback recovered virtual machines to the original site,
   and executes the same recovery plan with a single click.

#. Automated recovery of network and security settings – Site Recovery Manager
   integrates with VMware NSX, eliminating the need to reconfigure IP addresses
   on recovered virtual machines. Security policies are also preserved, further
   reducing configurations post-recovery.

#. Extensibility for custom automation – use the VMware vRealize® Orchestrator™
   plug-in for Site Recovery Manager to build custom automation workflows.
   Prebuilt workflows simplify the process to get you started with custom
   workflow creation.
