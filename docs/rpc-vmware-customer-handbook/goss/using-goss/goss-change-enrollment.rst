=============================
Modifying service enrollments
=============================

At this time, if you want to change the Guest OS Services enrollment for one of
your VMs, you must contact your support team to request the modification.
After a VM has been enrolled in GOSS it will no longer be displayed in the
enrollment device selection window.

.. note::
  Future development of GOSS automation processes might remove this limitation
  and enable you to use automation to change or remove service enrollments for
  your VMs.
