===========================
GOSS patching and upgrading
===========================

Rackspace patches and upgrades any Guest OS Services (GOSS) management
components as well as automation systems as needed and notifies you of any
impacting maintenance operations that could cause disruption to the VM
indexing or enrollment processes.

For details about patching and upgrading RPC-VMware, see the
`main patching and upgrading section
<https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rpc-vmware/rpc-vmware-customer-handbook/rpcv-patching-upgrading/>`_ in the handbook.
