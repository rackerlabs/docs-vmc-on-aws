GOSS authentication methods
===========================

Use your My Rackspace Portal credentials to request VM enrollment in Guest OS
Services.

During the Guest OS Services enrollment process, customers must provide
Rackspace with OS login credentials equivalent to root or Administrator
accounts.

Rackspace creates standard automation and OS login accounts to
perform OS actions that are included in the Guest OS Services. Rackspace
automatically rotates the passwords on these accounts.
