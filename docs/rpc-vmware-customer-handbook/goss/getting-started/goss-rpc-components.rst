The Guest OS Services (GOSS) uses a VM-based network access proxy server
residing in the management services of RPC-VMWare to enable access
to your enrolled VMs.

This device is planned to be used when additional features for GOSS are
released.

Rackspace might choose to remove this proxy server or change the resource
configuration as needed for GOSS.
