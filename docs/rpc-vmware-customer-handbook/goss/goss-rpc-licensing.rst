GOSS licensing
==============

For details about licensing, see the `main licensing section
<https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rpc-vmware/rpc-vmware-customer-handbook/rpcv-licensing/>`_ in the handbook.

*Individual OS instance licenses are not available at this time.*

Customer-provided Red Hat OS licenses are not compatible with the GOSS Patching
service for RHEL servers. Because Red Hat Licensing is essentially access to
RHEL patches for ongoing maintenance of a server, the customer-provided RHEL
license (Patching) service conflicts with configuration changes that
Rackspace makes when enrolling a RHEL server VM in GOSS Patching. If you
want to retain your customer-provided RHEL licenses, do not select the
Patching service option when enrolling RHEL Server VMs in GOSS.
