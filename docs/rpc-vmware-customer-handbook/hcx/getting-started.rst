Use cases
~~~~~~~~~

HCX covers the following use cases:

-  Hybridity services - Burst between on-premises and the private cloud
-  Data center extension
-  Data center evacuation
-  Disaster recovery

Key capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HCX provides the following capabilities:

- vSphere migrations with zero downtime
- Network extension and hybridity
- Scheduled migrations
- Disaster recovery and avoidance

Heterogenous network environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether you have VXLANs, NSX for vSphere, NSX-T, or No NSX at all, each of
these
factors can complicate your migration plan. The good news is that HCX works by
abstracting out the underlying network implementation, extending your networks
from on-premises to the cloud seamlessly without the need for complex and
time-consuming network re-architecture.
