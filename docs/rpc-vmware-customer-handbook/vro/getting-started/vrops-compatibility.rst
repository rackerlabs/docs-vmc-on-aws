vRealize Operations compatibility with third-party products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

vRealize Operations can be accessed using the vRealize Operations API.
You can use any third-party management, orchestration, or other type of
tools that are compatible with the vRealize Operations API. In this
case, the functionality of any such tool is limited by the vRealize
Operations features and capabilities as described in this handbook.
Ensure that the vRealize Operations API version of your environment is
compatible with the third-party tools that you want to use.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, existing role permissions provided by Rackspace do not
allow a custom or third-party tool to function. Contact the Rackspace
account team to determine if role permission adjustments are possible.
