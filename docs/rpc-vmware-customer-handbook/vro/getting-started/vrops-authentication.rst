vRealize Operations authentication methods
------------------------------------------

The vRealize Operations component uses the same authentication sources as
the vCenter. Therefore, the credentials that you use for vCenter work for
logging directly in to vRealize Operations. If you have a special case where
you need to configure specific authentication for vRealize Operations
appliance, contact Rackspace Support.
