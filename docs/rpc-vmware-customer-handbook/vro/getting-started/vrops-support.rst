vRealize Operations spheres of support
--------------------------------------

This section lists the vRealize Operations configuration and operations
tasks that Rackspace manages and the tasks that the customer is required
to manage.

**Rackspace managed**

-  Installs the appliance, configures its services, and supports its
   underlying infrastructure.

-  Connects the vCenter Server instance in vRealize Operations.

-  Upgrades all previous versions of vRealize Operations to latest
   Rackspace-supported release.

-  Performs uptime checks on the vRealize Operations instance.

-  Maintains a backup of the vRealize Operations instance and  restores
   vRealize Operations upon customer request.

-  Adds and deletes users and roles.

-  Configures authentication sources such as vCenter, Active Directory,
   or LDAP.

-  Adds and deletes certificates.

-  Manages all administrative permissions on cluster creation and
   configuration.

**Customer managed**

-  Requests vRealize Operations restoration from backup, when needed, by using
   support tickets (for example, if the user inadvertently deletes reports and
   other items).

-  Requests vRealize Operations configuration changes, if needed, by using
   support tickets. (Customers can view the configuration, but cannot
   modify it.)
