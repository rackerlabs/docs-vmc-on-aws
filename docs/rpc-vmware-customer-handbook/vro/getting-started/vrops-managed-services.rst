vRealize Operations managed services
------------------------------------

The vRealize Operations appliance and all supporting infrastructure are
managed by Rackspace. Rackspace provides support to keep the
vRealize Operations services available and functioning correctly. Internally,
Rackspace uses Rackspace Monitoring to monitor the availability of the vRealize
Operations appliance.

Rackspace is not responsible for building custom vRealize Operations objects
such as alerts, reports, and dashboards. If you need assistance with such
items, contact your support team.
