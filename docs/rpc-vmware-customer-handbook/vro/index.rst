VMware vRealize Operations for RPC-VMware
=========================================

VMware® vRealize® Operations™ helps you manage performance
utilization and capacity visualization of the Rackspace-hosted
virtualized infrastructure. vRealize Operations Endpoint Operations Management
provides additional visibility into the guest-OS layer and helps you
monitor in-guest services and the following applications: Microsoft® SQL
Server™, Microsoft Active Directory®, Apache® Tomcat™, and PostgreSQL®.

vRealize Operations collects and analyzes information from multiple data
sources and uses advanced analytics algorithms to learn and recognize
the “normal” behavior of every object that it monitors. Through dashboard views
and reports, you can view details so you can make informed decisions in
the following areas:

-  Issue resolution and root cause analysis

-  Environment health and advanced warning of potential issues

-  Capacity management and forecasting

vRealize Operations uses management packs to collect, analyze, and present
data from many VMware and third-party data sources, which provides a
holistic view of the RPC-VMware infrastructure and workloads.

This handbook is your primary resource for information related to the
vRealize Operations component of Rackspace Private Cloud
powered by VMware (RPC-VMware), such as getting
started, using, and getting help. It also includes references to additional
resources external to the handbook.

The vRealize Operations component is not available as a
stand-alone product.
