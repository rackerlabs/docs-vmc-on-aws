======================
Using managed services
======================

The Guest OS Services (GOSS) is an add-on component for Rackspace
Private Cloud powered by VMware (RPC-VMware) that allows you to request
Rackspace managed OS services for VMs. After the initial registration of
your RPC-VMware environment into the Rackspace automation systems, GOSS
enables you to request Rackspace managed OS administration, monitoring,
patching, licensing, and installation of antivirus agents. These are the
same OS services that are provided with Rackspace Dedicated Servers and
Rackspace Server Virtualization.

The Guest OS Services add-on component is not available as a stand-alone
product. It is an automation integration system that enables Rackspace to
provide OS services for Virtual Machines (VMs) that you deploy in, or
migrate to your RPC-VMware environment.
