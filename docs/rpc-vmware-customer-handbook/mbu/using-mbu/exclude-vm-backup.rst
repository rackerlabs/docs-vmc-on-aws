========================
Exclude a VM from backup
========================

Backups are configured to discover VMs automatically. If there is a VM
that you do not want to back up, submit a ticket through the
MyRackspace portal and provide the following information:

-  Cluster name
-  Host name
-  Name of VM to exclude

You can access a complete inventory of all VMs being backed through
vCenter.
