MBU compatibility with third-party products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you choose to implement a third-party solution to perform file and
application level backups within your private cloud, contact the
Rackspace account team to explore compatibility with MBU.


MBU compatibility when elevated permissions are needed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, existing role permissions provided by Rackspace do not
allow a custom or third-party tool to function. Contact the Rackspace
account team to determine if role permission adjustments are possible.
