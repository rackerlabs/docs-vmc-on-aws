====================
MBU managed services
====================

Rackspace provides support to keep the Managed Backup (MBU) service
available and functioning correctly. Rackspace ensures that the MBU
proxy VMs and other components are running and that backups are
successful.

Rackspace is not responsible for ensuring that VM-based applications
work successfully following VM restoration, but you can work with
Rackspace to restore VMs as you proactively test the ability to
restore application functionality.

For information about Rackspace Support Services related to all
RPC-VMware components, see the Rackspace Private Cloud powered by
VMware Customer Handbook.

.. TODO, after IA reorganization work, from Kelly: Let’s link to a
   specific section, if possible. For the user, this add-on handbook
   will appear to be part of the main handbook, so a general reference
   to it doesn’t make sense. We would probably want to link to the
   “Managed services for RPC-VMware” section directly.
